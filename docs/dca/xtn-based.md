## What is Neutrino Index Token? (XTN) (a.k.a USDN)

USDN collateralized by WAVES token used to be a reliable option to store value. However, the unprecedented bear market volatility in 2022 showed that the current USDN setup fails. This document describes transformation of USDN into XTN token collateralized by a set of multiple Waves Ecosystem tokens. In addition to the main task of solving the ongoing USDN crisis, the transformation is aimed at the following objectives:
* the new product should be lively and engaging both for the new and the existing community members;
* 'issue' and 'burn' operations should no longer drain the reserves (BR), which is the case with the currently existing swaps;
* the existing SURF, NSBT and gNSBT incentives should remain in place;
* the protocol should use all possible mechanisms to replenish the main contract reserves, such as collecting the protocol fees or staking WAVES and other tokens in reserves.

USDN becomes a Neutrino Index Token and gets a new name and ticker XTN
