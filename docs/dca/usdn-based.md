## What is USDN (WINDX)

USDN is a digital asset that is designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar. It is created using the Neutrino protocol and is collateralized by the WAVES token. Smart contracts govern all operations involving USDN, such as issuance, staking, and reward payouts, and arbitration bots can help maintain the 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The stability of USDN is ensured by the NSBT and SURF tokens. Users can exchange WAVES for USDN through the Neutrino smart contract, and the supply of USDN is limited by the restrictions of the Waves blockchain's Ride language.
