WXPools_TCI is a smart contract offered by the Heraclitus Project, in which you can issue derivatives for your WXLP tokens. Our dapp offers automatic compounding with WX Pools tAPY and provides collective boosting from constatly increasing gWX. As proof of your deposit, yield-bearing TCI tokens are issued. These derivatives include the value of your LP tokens and an automatic compound of boosted tAPY. They can be freely traded without the need for any term locks.

The core principle of Tokenized Compound Interest remains as described in the first publications on Medium. However, with WXPools_TCI, we have decided to keep all derivatives in one Vault and sponsor initial boosting for early adopters. This means that all early minted TCIs will benefit from already provided boosting from the WX we have locked in for the entire four-year deposit period.

In order to keep our Vault in a good boosting state, we split the initial tAPY to fold 20% into WX boosting and 80% back into LP of each TCI. This way, we are able to offer a great solution for small investors who are unable to create a high boost on their own. In this model, we offer derivatives with high-interest rates without additional requirements from investors. You set up a TCI once and enjoy automatic compounding and high APY for as long as you want. Remember that TCI derivatives are freely tradable, you can easily transfer those tokens between addresses without losing your boosting.

Currently, minting of WXPools_TCIs can be performed through the Waves Dapp UI. In the future, we plan to add more TCIs from lower WX weights. Additionally, we offer a liquidity pool on the PuzzleSwap, where each investor is able to further enhance returns by providing additional liquidity in our smart derivatives and their underlying assets.

The compounding oracles will create additional volume by purchasing LP tokens directly from this pool, instead of minting them through each WXLP smart contract. With this model and good liquidity, our TCI pools could be among the most prosperous on PuzzleSwap.
