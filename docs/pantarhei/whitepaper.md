Welcome to the Heraclitus Project’s documentation! This text is still a work in progress, as you may have noticed. What does this imply for you, dear reader? It means you’ll be a part of the excitement as we scramble to correct typos, clarify confusing statements, and generally try to make sense of this mess. Consider it a choose-your-own-adventure with only “perplexed,” “bemused,” and “completely lost” as options. But, hey, at the very least, after reading this, you’ll have a good story to tell. Hold on tight and enjoy the ride!
