## Tokenized Compound Interest

Tokenized Compound Interest (TCI) is a collection of tokenized derivatives developed as part of the Heraclitus Project, an initiative centered around the Waves Blockchain. TCI gives investors the ability to consolidate rewards from sNSBT, ecosystem's goverance tokens and AMM's LP tokens, directly into the value of a TCI derivative. These derivatives include the value of the LP tokens and in case of wxPoolsTCI an automatic compound of boosted tAPY. TCI can be freely traded without the need for any term locks.

The Heraclitus Project is currently offering 10 TCIs from the top high WX Pools emission weight, which benefits from the increasing collective WX boosting, locked in for a four-year period. In order to keep these TCI pools in a good boosting state, the project proposes to split the initial tAPY, folding 20% into WX boosting and 80% back into LP of each TCI. This way, the project can offer derivatives with high-interest rates without additional requirements from investors. Investors can set up a TCI once and enjoy automatic compounding and high APY for as long as they choose. It is important to note that TCI derivatives are freely tradable, and can be easily transferred between addresses without losing their boosting.

The Heraclitus Project plans to offer additional TCIs from lower WX weights in the future. The project also plans to increase boosting by arbitrage and market making strategies to further enhance returns for investors.

In addition to these offerings, the Heraclitus Project offer a pool on PuzzleSwap where investors can further enhance their returns by providing additional liquidity in the smart derivatives and their underlying assets. The project's compounding oracles will create additional volume by purchasing LP tokens directly from this pool, rather than minting them through each WXLP smart contract. With this model, the TCI pools offered by the Heraclitus Project are expected to be among the most prosperous on PuzzleSwap.

To mint a new TCI, investors can use the official Waves Dapp interface and attach their LP tokens to the TCI smart contract. The Heraclitus Project develops a custom web interface for minting and managing TCIs, which will be accessed through the project's website. The final version of the UI will be implemented in the Panta Rhei Protocol.

The investors should be aware of the potential risks and uncertainties involved. The value of TCIs may fluctuate over time, and there is no guarantee of profit or protection against loss. Investors should carefully consider their own financial circumstances and the risks involved before making any investment decisions.
