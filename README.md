## The Heraclitus Project Documentation
Welcome to the official repository for the Heraclitus Project Documentation! The Heraclitus Project is an initiative centered around the Waves Blockchain, and is focused on developing innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions that maximize returns and manage risk for investors.

### Panta Rhei Protocol
At the heart of the Heraclitus Project is the Panta Rhei Protocol, which combines Tokenized Compound Interest (TCI) derivatives and Dollar-cost Averaging (DCA) smart contracts into a single interface. The Panta Rhei Protocol offers a range of powerful features, including DAO capabilities and a governance token that generates yield from the transaction fees of the protocol.

### Tokenized Compound Interest
TCI is a collection of tokenized derivatives that incorporate compound interest into their value. These derivatives give investors the ability to consolidate rewards from tokens such as sNSBT, sVIRES, sWX, and LP tokens directly into the value of a TCI. TCIs can be freely traded without the need for any term locks, and offer investors the potential for long-term growth and high returns.

### Dollar-cost Averaging
DCA is a popular investment strategy that involves spreading out purchases over a longer period of time in order to mitigate the risk of investing a large sum of money in a volatile market. This can be particularly useful for low-time preference investors, who are willing to forego short-term gains in favor of the potential for long-term growth. The Panta Rhei Protocol incorporates DCA smart contracts, which allow investors to easily implement this strategy in their DeFi investments.

### WX Strategies
The Heraclitus Project also includes a range of trading strategies that are implemented directly into the WX Network. These strategies are designed to help investors maximize their returns and manage risk in the dynamic DeFi market.

### NextWeek Network
In addition to its core DeFi solutions, the Heraclitus Project is also publishing an early interface to interact with already deployed smart contracts on the Waves mainnet. The NextWeek Network will offer an early access to a range of dapps, tools and resources for investors, including a statistics page that collects all relevant blockchain information.
