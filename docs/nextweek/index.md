## NextWeek Network

The NextWeek Network is a prototype web-based user interface designed to facilitate interaction with our smart contracts. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface through which users can interact with our smart contract.

Simply go to [](https://nextweek.network) to access the NextWeek Network. The website has a simple interface that allows users to easily access and interact with our smart contracts.

After connecting your Keeper Wallet to the NextWeek Network, you can begin interacting with our smart contracts. The user interface is intended to be simple and easy to use, allowing you to perform transactions and other operations quickly.

All of our officially released smart contracts are supported by the NextWeek Network. This includes Genesis DCA, PlutoBitcoin DCA, sNSBT TCI, and fifteen wxPools TCI derivatives, as well as any future smart contracts. The user interface makes it simple and easy to interact with these smart contracts.

Please keep in mind that the NextWeek Network is still in its early stages and may contain bugs or other issues. If you encounter any issues while using the interface, please notify us so that we can investigate and resolve the problem as soon as possible.
