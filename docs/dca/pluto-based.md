## What is PLUTO

The PLUTO token is a reserve currency designed to be resistant to bear markets. It is launched by the Pluto Protocol, which will also offer staking rewards to PLUTO token holders. PLUTO can be purchased on decentralized exchanges such as Waves Exchange, Puzzle Swap, and Swop.fi, using USDN or USDT. The value of PLUTO is derived from the collateral held in the protocol's treasury, and any unsold PLUTO tokens will be burned.

### GenesisDCA 

GenesisDCA is a smart contract that allows investors to utilize the Dollar-cost Averaging (DCA) strategy on the Waves blockchain. The contract operates in monthly rounds, with a 24-48 hour deposit window at the beginning of each round. During the lock period of 43200 blocks (approximately 30 days), daily automated DCA is performed using compound interest from the native staking of the Pluto token. At the end of each round, funds from the DCA are distributed to holders of DCA derivatives, and investors have a 48 hour window to withdraw their base capital by exchanging their derivatives back to the base capital. If the base capital is not withdrawn within this time frame, it will automatically be entered into the next round. Investors can also choose to sell their derivatives at any time to exit their DCA position. In the upcoming releases, DAOs will shape the investment prospects for each DCA dapp.

### Pluto to Bitcoin DCA

PLUTO-Bitcoin DCA is a smart contract that allows you to automatically implement a Dollar-cost Averaging strategy with your investments in Bitcoin. The smart contract is built on the Waves blockchain and uses the PLUTO token as the base capital for the investment. Unlike other DCA contracts that operate in rounds with term locks, PLUTO-Bitcoin DCA allows you to deposit and withdraw your funds at any time without any restrictions. The contract will perform a daily automated DCA based on the compounded interest earned from your investment in Bitcoin. All of the accumulated funds from the DCA can be manually claimed by the investor at any time. This provides a flexible and convenient way for you to apply a DCA strategy to your investments in Bitcoin.

It's important to note that at this time the Pluto-based DCA smart contracts only accumulate tokens from compounded interest in the PLUTO token through native staking. This means that you are not relinquishing any portion of your original PLUTO deposit during the DCA process. To see how the Pluto-based DCA dapps operate, you can check the smart contract addresses transactions.
