## Dollar-cost Averaging

Dollar-cost averaging is a common investment strategy. Rather than investing the entire amount at once, it involves dividing the investment amount into regular, equal installments and investing these installments at regular intervals. Because it allows the investor to spread purchases over a longer period of time, this strategy is frequently used to reduce the risks associated with investing a large sum of money in a volatile market.

For example, instead of investing the entire $1,000 USDT at once, an investor who wants to invest $1,000 USDT in a specific token may choose to invest $100 USDT per month for ten months. This can help to mitigate the impact of short-term price fluctuations on the investment's overall value.

Dollar-cost averaging can be used with a variety of investment vehicles in the DeFi and cryptocurrency markets, including stablecoins, tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). It is important to note that this strategy does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss, and the value of the investment may fluctuate over time. However, it can be a useful tool for low-time preference investors looking to manage risk and potentially increase their long-term returns in these markets.

### What do we offer

For our decentralized applications, we provide two approaches to Dollar-cost Averaging (DCA).

The first approach is based on rounds, with each round having a 48-hour deposit-withdraw window. DCA funds are distributed monthly via mass transfer, and any remaining base capital after a completed round will automatically participate in the next round. Everyone who deposits a base capital receives derivatives, which can be freely traded at any time.

The second approach to DCA does not use term locks and instead provides manual deposit, withdrawal, and claim functions. This gives investors more control over their investments because they can deposit and withdraw funds at their leisure. It should be noted, however, that this approach may necessitate more active management on the part of the investor.

First DCA dapps are available with a base capital in PLUTO and USDN (XTN).
