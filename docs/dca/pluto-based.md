## What is PLUTO

The PLUTO token is a reserve currency designed to be resistant to bear markets. It is launched by the Pluto Protocol, which will also offer staking rewards to PLUTO token holders. PLUTO can be purchased on decentralized exchanges such as Waves Exchange, Puzzle Swap, and Swop.fi, using USDN or USDT. The value of PLUTO is derived from the collateral held in the protocol's treasury, and any unsold PLUTO tokens will be burned.

### GenesisDCA

GenesisDCA is a smart contract that allows investors to utilize the Dollar-cost Averaging (DCA) strategy on the Waves blockchain. The contract operates in monthly rounds, with a 24-48 hour deposit window at the beginning of each round. During the lock period of 43200 blocks (approximately 30 days), daily automated DCA is performed using compound interest from the native staking of the Pluto token. At the end of each round, funds from the DCA are distributed to holders of DCA derivatives, and investors have a 48 hour window to withdraw their base capital by exchanging their derivatives back to the base capital. If the base capital is not withdrawn within this time frame, it will automatically be entered into the next round. Investors can also choose to sell their derivatives at any time to exit their DCA position. In the upcoming releases, DAOs will shape the investment prospects for each DCA dapp.

It is important to note that the Pluto-based DCA smart contracts currently only accumulate tokens through native staking from compounded interest in the PLUTO token. This means that you will not give up any of your original PLUTO deposit during the DCA process. Check the smart contract addresses transactions to see how the Pluto-based DCA dapps work.
