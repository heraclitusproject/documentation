## The Heraclitus Project

The Heraclitus Project is an initiative focused primarily on the Waves Blockchain. It has developed a collection of tokenized derivatives called Tokenized Compound Interest (TCI) that incorporate compound interest into their value, as well as automated Dollar-cost Averaging Smart Contracts. 

The project has plans to develop a protocol with its own governance token and staking capabilities, as well as to implement trading strategies directly into the WX Network and create a statistics page collecting relevant blockchain information. These features are not yet available, but they are being developed as part of the Heraclitus Project.

TCI allows investors to consolidate rewards from tokens such as native governance tokens, and AMM's LP tokens into the value of a TCI. This creates a tradable token that includes compound interest from the regular distribution of rewards, as well as the value of the base asset (BA). In addition, the regular auto-buy feature increases buying pressure for the base asset, thereby also increasing transaction volume.

Dollar-cost averaging strategies can be incorporated into smart contracts in various ways. One approach is to build it based on term locks, initially offering 3/6/12-month investment programs. However, the Heraclitus Project recognized that this solution may not work for everyone, so it implemented a system of investing rounds and tradable DCA positions as a compromise for low-time preference investors and traders who are not interested in term locks. This system includes a lock period of 43200 blocks (approximately 30 days) and a fully spendable DCA in the form of a token. Other DCA smart contracts, that we offer are built without investing rounds and with a manual deposit, withdraw, and claim functions.
